# Hades Agent project context

Status date: 2026-08-01

## Mission

Build Hades Agent, an exact Hermes TUI clone rewritten in Rust, with a
development loop that lets bounded AI agents make independently verifiable
progress from August 1, 2026 through 2027.

## Confirmed current state

- The repository began as an empty workspace on 2026-08-01.
- Rust 1.97.1 is available and pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- The initial scaffold is a Cargo workspace with core state, application
  transitions, a Ratatui view, and a CLI entry point.
- The autonomous development control plane lives in `.hades/` and `.agents/`.

## Unknown until observed

- Hermes TUI startup sequence, terminal dimensions, color palette, typography,
  keymap, focus model, copy, error states, timing, persistence, and exit rules.
- Which Hermes behaviors are stable contracts versus implementation details.
- The reference version, commit, build flags, and environment that define
  parity for each observation.

Unknowns are deliberate. The first product task is to capture the reference
contract rather than let the scaffold become an accidental specification.

## Working vocabulary

- **Reference** — the Hermes TUI build and environment used for a specific
  observation.
- **Observation** — a provenance-bearing record of one reference interaction.
- **Trace** — ordered inputs and observable outputs that can be replayed.
- **Golden frame** — a normalized terminal buffer snapshot used as a visual
  oracle.
- **Parity claim** — a statement backed by an observation and an executable
  Hades oracle.
- **Unknown** — a behavior not yet observed or not stable enough to claim.

## Non-goals for the scaffold

The scaffold does not pretend to implement Hermes behavior that has not been
captured. It provides the seams needed to add that behavior safely: typed
events, a reducer, deterministic rendering, snapshot output, task dependencies,
and proof-required task completion.
