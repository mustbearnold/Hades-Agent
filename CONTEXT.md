# Hades Agent project context

Status date: 2026-08-01

## Mission

Build Hades Agent, an exact Hermes TUI clone rewritten in Rust, with a
development loop that lets bounded AI agents make independently verifiable
progress from August 1, 2026 through 2027.

## Confirmed current state

- The repository began as an empty workspace on 2026-08-01.
- Rust 1.97.1 is available and pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- The initial scaffold is a Cargo workspace with core state, application
  transitions, a Ratatui view, and a CLI entry point.
- The autonomous development control plane lives in `.hades/` and `.agents/`.
- The Hermes reference is pinned to commit
  `e444d165807f489b5c1ab8e4a612c8d09c2e67a2`; the provenance and sanitized
  startup/lifecycle artifacts are in `docs/parity/observations/OBS-0001*`.
- HAD-003 established a real-PTY lifecycle oracle in
  `scripts/probe_tui_lifecycle.py`.
- HAD-004 implements the first reference-backed core transition:
  submit text, enter a typed busy state, interrupt with Ctrl+C, then exit with
  Ctrl+C from ready.

## Unknown until observed

- Hermes TUI color palette, typography, complete keymap, focus model, copy,
  error states, timing, persistence, and the remaining interaction surfaces.
- Which Hermes behaviors are stable contracts versus implementation details.
- Successful provider/model streaming, tool calls, and the exact behavior of
  terminal-dependent surfaces beyond the captured observations.

Unknowns are deliberate. The first product task is to capture the reference
contract rather than let the scaffold become an accidental specification.

## Working vocabulary

- **Reference** — the Hermes TUI build and environment used for a specific
  observation.
- **Observation** — a provenance-bearing record of one reference interaction.
- **Trace** — ordered inputs and observable outputs that can be replayed.
- **Golden frame** — a normalized terminal buffer snapshot used as a visual
  oracle.
- **Parity claim** — a statement backed by an observation and an executable
  Hades oracle.
- **Unknown** — a behavior not yet observed or not stable enough to claim.

## Non-goals for the scaffold

The bootstrap application still does not pretend to implement Hermes behavior
that has not been captured. It provides the seams needed to add that behavior
safely: typed events, a reducer, deterministic rendering, snapshot output, task
dependencies, and proof-required task completion.
